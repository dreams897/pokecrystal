## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What features from Crystal are being kept and which are being removed?
A: Some features from Crystal will be quite beneficial and an upgrade to features in Gen 1. These features include shiny Pokémon, a set-able clock (new morning, day, and night spawns!), Stereo audio option and much more! Some features will be removed that aren't useful to Gen 1 or don't serve a purpose that I can justify. These include the Cellphone feature and Eggs since there will be no baby Pokémon. The PokéGear will likely be renamed to "Clock" because the cellphone feature will be removed making it less worthy of the title "Gear". 

### Q: How many Pokémon are available?
A: All original 151 Pokémon are obtainable and carefully placed throughout the map or available through trades, Celedon Prize Room, or gifts. No Pokémon past Gen 1 will be present in the game. 

### Q: Is MISSINGNO still an issue (feature)?
A: I'm probably going to make MISSINGNO a properly numbered Pokémon for less problems, but haven't implemented that yet.

### Q: Is Mew available?
A: Mew will be behind the truck and should be accessable after getting 4+ gym badges

### Q: What are the new in-game trades?
A: As follows:

Give: Marowak

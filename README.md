## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is this currently playable? Where can I download the ROM?
**A**: This is a work in progress, but once the first 3 Gym badges are obtainable I will be releasing a demo. In the meantime, you are welcome to build the ROM and it is playble up until Cerulean City.
### Q: What features from Crystal are being kept and which are being removed?
**A**: Some features from Crystal will be quite beneficial and an upgrade to features in Gen 1. These features include shiny Pokémon, a set-able clock (spawns depend on time of day), better battle engine, Stereo audio option, item shortcuts, and much more! Some features will be removed that aren't useful to Gen 1 or don't serve a purpose that I can justify. These include Eggs (since there will be no baby Pokémon) and the Radio. The Town Map is an item just like in RBY.

### Q: What post-game content will be added?
**A**: Some restored content such as the Prof. Oak battle, a couple Pokemon that aren't obtainable in vanilla gameplay (both Fossils), and I will consider some newer features like Swarms. Additionally the **Phone* has been renamed to *Pager** and will allow the player to re-battle trainers post-game! This will likely be it's own item and not part of the PokéGear.

### Q: Will you keep new moves and features for Pokémon?
**A**: Yes, I plan on keeping all of the new moves as well as some features like Magikarp length, etc. Items that make Pokémon evolve past Gen 1 will not be kept. 

### Q: How many Pokémon are available?
**A**: All original 151 Pokémon are obtainable and carefully placed throughout the map or available through trades, Celedon Prize Room, or gifts. No Pokémon past Gen 1 will be present in the game. 

### Q: Is MISSINGNO still an issue (feature)?
**A**: I plan to include MISSINGNO, which will have the same appearance but without all the bugs (and with a new animated sprite!).

### Q: Is Mew available?
**A**: Mew will be behind the truck by the S.S. Anne and will be accessable after becoming Champion.

### Q: What are the new in-game trades?
**A**: As follows:

**Give**: Machoke 
**Get**: Haunter (evolves!)
